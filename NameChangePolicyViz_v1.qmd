## Background

In 2021, the Trans Name Change Policy Working Group (NCPWG) authored a article for the Committee for Publishing Ethics (COPE) that outlined their vision for "a more trans inclusive publishing world" (Tannenbaum et al, 2021). In the article, the group detailed barriers that impact trans, nonbinary, and other individuals' ability to receive full credit for their academic work in the manner in which they would wish to be addressed. They also laid out guiding principles for name change policies that would enable publishing to be more inclusive and to reduce emotional and intellectual barriers to achieving a version of record (VOR) that reflects \[need to wordsmith\].

The principles discussed in the article are as follows:

> Accessibility - Name changes should be available to authors upon request without legal documentation, unnecessary barriers, burdens, or labor placed upon the author making the request.
>
> Comprehensiveness - Name changes should remove all instances of an author's previous name from the records maintained and disseminated by the publisher.
>
> Invisibility - Name changes should not draw attention to the gender identity of an author, nor create a clear juxtaposition between the current name and the previous name.
>
> Expediency and Simplicity - Name changes should be implemented in a timely manner, and with a minimum of bureaucratic overhead.
>
> Recurrence and Maintenance - Publishers should regularly audit and correct new instances of changed names in order to prevent ongoing dissemination of incorrect information.
>
> (Tannenbaum et al, 2021)

While both the COPE and the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) formed working groups to develop recommended practice in relation to the changing of author names post-publication in the academic record, neither group has released official recommendations as of the beginning of 2023. Still, the past three years have seen a proliferation of publisher-driven development of name change policies for their journals.

With the growing presence of name change policies in mind, this paper seeks to better understand how health science publishers, databases, and other organizations are handling author name changes and the extent of the presence of these policies in the health publishing landscape.

## Methodology

### Scope

The data acquired for analysis for this survey focuses on the content of indexed in PubMed (including Medline) and the full-text database PubMed Central. It was acquired through querying the National Center for Biotechnology Information's xxxxxxx for data providing entities that contribute to the service. These data providers can be publishing companies as well as \[Silverchair, etc.\]

In order to create a more manageable search and to reflect the researcher's linguistic capabilities, the list of publishers to search was limited to those that included English in their names. The list was also limited to current contributors of citations to the PubMed landscape. Lastly, publishers that provided data separately but are members of a publishing group or are a subsidiary of a larger publisher that provides data to PubMed were combined into their larger body with the assumption that policies at the higher level apply to their subsidiaries.

A total of 931 publishing bodies were included as part of the data.

### Policy Identification

Following the identification of publishers included in PubMed, a search was conducted for whether each publisher has published a name change policy.

The process for searching for these policies involved the identification of a search string that would effectively identify a publisher's policy page if extant and the use of the string for every publisher. The terms that were selected were the publishers name, "journal," and "name change policy."

In the Google search browser, executed searches share the same URL format, varying only in the text to be searched. To streamline the process of conducting the search for each publisher, once the terms to be added to the search were identified, OpenRefine was used to take the names of each publisher and include them in a URL that would lead to the search results.

After the URLs were created, they were opened by hand and the results of the search were cataloged for later analysis.

In acknowledgement of the fact that not all policies include the phrase "name change policy" in their documentation, if no results were returned as part of the initial search results, the publisher was added to a list for secondary searching. In addition to no-result publishers, following the initial identification of publishing bodies with name change policies, additional publishers were added to this secondary searching list in coordination with the PubMed team based on the weighted presence of publishers in PubMed. Following the creation of this secondary list, one new search strings was created to attempt to identify the possible presence of a policy: publishers name, "author name" AND "policy." In addition to this search string, the policy webpages of these publishers were hand searched for potential policies.

A total of 39 publishers were identified as having some form of name change policy.

### Policy Features

Once the publishers with policies were identified, they underwent a content analysis that was based on the principles put forth by the NCWG.

Each policy was read at least twice and assessed for their adherence to concepts of accessibility, comprehensiveness, invisibility, expediency and simplicity, and recurrence and maintenance.

What emerged from this analysis was the identification of common features that were included in these policies, which then became the basis for the criteria chosen to compare the policies as part of this work. The criteria documented about the policies are as follows:

**Invisibility**

-   Invisible Option - Does the publisher offer the ability to change an author's name without the publication of an erratum, correction, or other type of notice?

-   Mention of co-authors or corresponding authors - Does the publisher mention the contacting of co-authors or corresponding authors? If so, is it a requirement that someone outside of the author and the publisher themselves be contacted?

**Comprehensiveness**

-   Pronouns - Does the policy include mention of the ability to change pronouns?

-   Photos - Does the policy include mention of the ability to change associated photos?

-   Email - Does the policy include mention of the ability to change associated email?

**Expediency and Simplicity**

-   Proof of Change - Does the publisher require proof of name change?

-   Confirmation of Identify - Does the publisher require proof of identify? If so, to what level of proof do they require?

-   Method of request - How does the publisher require the author to initiate a name change?

**Recurrence and maintenance**

-   Mention of the Internal Retention of Data - Does the publisher mention whether or not the initial name under which the article was published will be retained in their data or not?

-   Updating past citations - Does the publisher mention/offer to update past citations of the paper to reflect the new name?

-   Provision of updated data to indexing services - Does the publisher mention whether they will reserve the article's data to indexing services?

### Policy Analysis

Following policy related data collection, findings were collected and tallied in a single spreadsheet. Using xxxx data provided by the, corresponding journal totals for each publisher were identified and added to the spreadsheet to be included as part of the analysis.

A total of 6267 journals were included as part of the data.

Data analysis and visualization were performed in Microsoft Excel and R.

## Discussion

Unique features of certain policies

-   Springer/Nature's Take on guiding principles

    -   **Comprehensive** across all relevant search systems and across the version of records and associated metadata;

    -   **Silent** so that readers will not be aware that a correction to an author's name has been made, with authors given the option of the change being silent or flagged;

    -   **Inclusive** as to allow name changes for various reason ― principally to serve the needs of transgender scholars but also other reasons such as religious reasons;

    -   **Cascaded** without unnecessary burden on authors to update abstracting and indexing sites

        ([Springer Nature introduces trans inclusive name change policy \| Corporate Affairs Homepage \| Springer Nature](https://group.springernature.com/gp/group/media/press-releases/springer-nature-introduces-trans-inclusive-name-change-policy/19305714))

-   Limited number of publishers offering citation updates

    -   Several acknowledge these limitations and mention efforts to create a consortium of publishing bodies that would work together to make these updates

        -   SAGE, ACS, AIP

    -   9 publishers state that they cannot update it, which in and of itself is useful (see later commentary on the idea that comprehensiveness is better than vagueness with regards to what a publisher can and cannot do).

-   Several publishers offer a variety of options for silent vs. in-print changes

    -   More options = more freedom?

        -   Author linked data

            -   One author entry (current name replaces deadname)

            -   Linked author entries (allowing for discovery based on deadname)

            -   Unattached authorship (no association between deadname and current name)

        -   Option to publish general note

            -   Correction asking citers to ensure correct citation, noting that a name has changed but not indicating whose

        -   Contacting co-authors/corresponding authors

            -   Most leave any contact up to the author independently, but some offer to make the contact and a few require that the corresponding author be contacted in order for the article to be changed.

Alignment with underlying principles

-   'Calling out' trans and nb authors and making the policy only available to them is ultimately harmful in its own way.

    -   Having a policy that makes at-risk cases 'special' inherently heightens/highlights that risk rather than diffusing it

        -   Springer Nature

        -   PLoS

-   Lack of clear instructions and ambiguity of what will and won't be changed might make it seem like an open policy, but it also leaves a lot of potential anxiety and unknowns around how a name change request that asks for more than a name will be received by the publisher

    -   Problem publishers include: MIT and IOS Press

-   Inclusion of mention of data retention - ultimate transparency

    -   Helps authors to understand the process of data distribution? Most mention it is possible that 3rd party indexers might have their own policy/that they have no control over when those update, but how clear is it to someone who doesn't understand the publishing process? Need for better transparency on 3rd party indexers' end?

-   Mention/influence of COPE and the COPE guidelines

    -   8 publishers mention COPE article on name change policies

    -   Additional 3 don't mention the article but mention following COPE guidelines

    -   Others cite other journals/publisher initiatives as being instigative/inspiring for their policy

        -   Need to find which ones again oops

How can medical librarians prepare scholars who are looking to change the version of record and also how can they advocate for inclusive policies

-   Are librarians prepared to address this in our own information architecture?

-   journals such as JMLA should develop policies

-   creating libguides that help point to relevant resources

-   advocate for these principles within institutional repositories

-   advocacy within publishing engagement

Discussion question: What are the roles of health librarians and informationists in developing and facilitating an inclusive publishing environment?
